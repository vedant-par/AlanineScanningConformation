Alanine scanning full ABL1 Kinase sequence. The alanine scanning technique utilizes a for loop iterating through each character in the native sequence and randomly substitutes 5-15% of the characters in the sequences with an 'A', simulating random alanine substitutions. We ran the masking algorithm 10 times to generate 10 alanine scanned sequences. Our MSA is then generated by using the alanine scanned full length sequence as input to MMSeqs2, aiming to slightly change the MSAs, but without actually mutating the sequences within the MSA, which is the biggest difference from the SPEACH_AF technique. The Alphafold2 Shallow MSA technique is then used on these MSAs as explained in other folder to make structure prediction. Slight variability, need to explore more. 12 recycles per model, total of 70 predicted structures.
